# Twitter-for-School-Shooting-Analysis-
This project revolves around a comprehensive analysis of dark data extracted from Twitter, specifically focusing on two tragic incidents: the STEM School Highlands Ranch Shooting and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Shooting in 2019. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the analysis dives deep into understanding public reactions, sentiments, and information sharing during these critical events.

## Key Highlights:

- **Data Source:** Archived Twitter data from May 2019, comprising over 15 million tweets.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Rigorous cleaning, stop word removal, and feature selection to refine the dataset to 5,000 tweets.
- 
- ### Natural Language Processing (NLP) Models

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
   - Used SpaCy's pre-trained model to identify and classify entities within the Twitter text, including persons, organizations, locations, events, and more.
   - Customized the model to recognize specific entity types relevant to the analysis.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Employed VADER sentiment intensity analyzer and Twitter RoBERTa sentiment model.
   - Analyzed sentiments expressed in tweets to understand the emotional tone, focusing on positive, negative, and neutral categories.

3. **Topic Modeling:**
   - Utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Top2Vec for uncovering hidden thematic structures within the Twitter data.
   - Explored prevalent themes, subjects, and discussions related to school shootings.

4. **Text Summarization:**
   - Applied advanced language model (WizardLM) for text summarization.
   - Generated concise summaries of tweets to provide a clear overview of the conversations surrounding the tragic incidents.
