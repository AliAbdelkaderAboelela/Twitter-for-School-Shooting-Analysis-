    "# Dataset Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "We have utilized a dataset obtained from the ArchiveTeam Twitter Stream, specifically focusing on the month of May in the year 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset, available at https://archive.org/details/archiveteam-twitter-stream-2019-05, holds valuable information from the public Twitter stream, capturing a snapshot of global conversations during that time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this dataset, We have identified two significant incidents involving criminal activities that occurred during May 2019:\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEM School Highlands Ranch Shooting (2019)**:\n",
    "On May 7, 2019, a tragic shooting took place at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado, USA. This unfortunate event resulted in the loss of one student's life and left eight others injured. The incident sent shockwaves throughout the community and the nation, sparking discussions on various platforms, including social media like Twitter. The dataset we've collected captures the sentiments, reactions, and discussions surrounding this incident, providing a glimpse into how people responded to and shared information about this devastating event.\n",
    "\n",
    "**University of North Carolina at Charlotte Shooting (2019)**:\n",
    "Another distressing incident occurred on April 30, 2019, at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. In this incident, a gunman opened fire within a classroom, leading to the tragic deaths of two students and injuring four others. The dataset I've compiled encompasses the conversations, opinions, and reactions expressed on Twitter following this event. Analyzing this data could offer insights into public sentiment, the spread of information, and reactions to such events on social media platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "By delving into these specific incidents within the larger dataset, We aim to gain a deeper understanding of how Twitter users engage with and respond to real-world events of varying magnitudes. Through data analysis and processing techniques, We plan to extract valuable insights, patterns, and trends from these conversations, shedding light on the role of social media in disseminating information, expressing emotions, and fostering discussions during critical moments in our society. This endeavor not only showcases the potential of data science but also underscores the importance of understanding public discourse in the context of significant events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We've collected information from Twitter during the entire month of May in 2019. This information is stored in special files called JSON files, which contain details about tweets people posted.\n",
    "\n",
    "From these files, We've picked out specific details that are important for my research. These details include when the tweet was posted, what the tweet says, where it was posted from, the person's username, their location, and other things like how many followers they have.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we're not just using any tweets. we're focusing on a particular issue. we're interested in tweets that talk about certain words like \"shooting,\" \"STEM,\" \"killed,\" and \"Charlotte.\" These words are linked to two events that happened in May 2019:\n",
    "\n",
    "The STEM School Highlands Ranch Shooting on May 7, 2019, where one student died and others got hurt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The University of North Carolina at Charlotte Shooting on April 30, 2019, which resulted in two students losing their lives and others getting injured.\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at tweets with these specific words, we want to understand how people reacted and talked about these incidents on Twitter. we want to see what they said and how they felt. This can help us learn how social media like Twitter can reflect people's thoughts during important times. Our goal is to find insights from this data that can help us better understand how people connect and respond to big events in our society using platforms like Twitter."
